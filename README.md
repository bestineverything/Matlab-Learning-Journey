MATLAB Learning Journey

Welcome to my MATLAB development repository. This project serves as a living document of my technical growth as a Mechanical Engineering student. 

Here, I organize everything from foundational syntax practice to complex engineering simulations, focusing on how computational tools solve real-world physical problems.

📂 Repository Structure
I maintain this repository as a "Monorepo" to track my daily progress. You will find:
* Basics: Fundamental syntax, matrix operations, and loop logic.
* Numerical Methods: Implementation of algorithms (Newton-Raphson, Runge-Kutta, etc.).
* Engineering Applications: Scripts solving problems in Thermodynamics, Fluid Mechanics, and Statics.
* Visualizations: Plotting data and creating physical models.

🛠️ Tech Stack
* Language: MATLAB
* Focus: Computational Engineering, Data Analysis, and Simulation.

Note: This repository is updated frequently with small, iterative improvements to reflect continuous learning.
